# CoopKaliJam

Hey there, music lovers! Welcome to **CoopKaliJam**, a game I've developed for **React Jam Winter 2023**. This game is about playing virtual Kalimba with a twist - you and your friend share the Kalimba, each with only half!

## About React Jam

**React Jam** is a special online event where React developers, come together to build awesome games in **10 days** (actually 13, because of the holidays!). It's a chance to showcase creativity, experiment with ideas, and learn from a fantastic community. This Winter React Jam, the theme is all about **"Cooperation"**.

## Why CoopKaliJam?

I made this game, because I'm super passionate about the kalimba, a beautiful instrument that not many people know about. Through CoopKaliJam, I want more folks to discover the joy of playing this magical  instrument. Music has this amazing power to bring people together, and I believe that by sharing the kalimba's magic, we can unite even more people through the joy of music.

## Modes of Play

The 17-key Kalimba is divided in half for solo players, giving you 9 notes. Convince a friend to join, and they'll get the other half (8 notes).

- **Solo Mode:** experience the challenge with 9 notes all to yourself. Can you master the melody solo?

- **Co-op Mode:** team up with a friend and have a combined total of 9 | 8 notes. Collaborate to create beautiful tunes together!

- **Spectator Mode:** join in when two players are already jamming, and become a spectator. While you won't have any Kalimba keys to play, you can enjoy watching their performance and see what level they choose.
